## **Inspiration**

<aside>
💡 We all have an inner voice that we engage from time to time that guides our reflection. This engagement in self-talk makes us conscious of our attitudes, feelings, and behaviors. 

But what if healing ourselves is not modifying an attitude, not altering our feelings, not changing our behaviors, but shifting a “presence”, an awareness, an energy? What if we experience “presence” not by engaging in fixing the parts but by detaching ourselves from ourselves to re-examine and reconstruct the whole?

When we guide ourselves through day-to-day situations, we naturally use the first-person pronouns “I”, “me”, “mine”. But findings (Kross et al., 2014; Moser et al., 2017) have shown that third-person introspection––using our own names to refer to the self––is an effective form of cognitive therapy that allows us to reason wisely, overcome bias-promoting egocentric impulses, self-regulate under stress-arousing conditions, and viewing uncertainties as challenges rather than threats.

We engage the form a perspective; we detach to form perspectives. While we are all protagonists of our own lives, every once in a while we need to shift our presence from self-immersion to self-distancing––to step outside and be the audience of ourselves.
